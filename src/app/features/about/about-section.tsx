      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi there! I'm Mikael, an enthusiastic student on a journey to becoming a
        skilled software developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I caught the bug to writing software during my studies in 2019 when I
        had the opportunity to be part of a team to establish a lobby service at
        our school, where students would be responsible for monitoring the lobby
        as well as creating reports of the events that took place. As a side
        project, I became interested in trying to create a reporting system to
        ensure uniformity in the reports.
      </p>
      <p>
        My solution was VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) in Excel, which I
        used to create a form that would generate a report based on the user's
        input. The solution was far from being even remotely pretty, but it got
        the job done.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this experience, I realized that I enjoyed the whole process. I
        enjoyed the continuous learning and problem solving, constantly trying
        to find ways to improve the application, either by implementing new
        features or by improving the existing ones. Something that struct me as
        particularly rewarding was teaching my fellow students how to use the
        system and seeing them use it in their daily work, knowing that I had
        created something that was useful to others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon graduation, I decided to explore software development further, and
        this path continues to excite and inspire me to this day.
